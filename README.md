##Code functionality
This application makes use of the MVC architecture with a connection to an SQL database for the storage of user data. The application will begin by requesting the user to login or register to gain access to the website. Once logged in, the user will be shown a list of books that are available for purchase. The user can then add these books to their shopping cart by clicking the "Add to cart" buttons shown next to them. Once the user is satisfied with the number of books they have chosen, they can go to their shopping cart and click to proceed to checkout. The checkout function will be handled through paypal and the user will have completed their order once payment is confirmed.
